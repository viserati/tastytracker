The files in the "Chapter 5 Files" folder are the three Bootstrap/HTML only files as they stand at the end of that chapter, plus the _custom.scss file which needs to be placed in the appropriate directory under the Bootstrap install and processed with Grunt, as described in the text of chapter 5.

The files in the "Chapter 7 Files" folder are the contents of JUST the application directory, not including index.html or any of the other files from the project directory, as they stand at the end of that chapter.

The files in "Final Files" are a complete set of application files in their final form.

Note that the package.json file in the same directory as this README file is not the package.json file for the TastyTracker project! It's used only to install these examples. The package.json file for the TastyTracker project can be found in the Final Files folder.
